<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Agnes. I’m 7, and I live in London. I like drawing, playing with lego, and reading books. My favourite food is seafood noodle soup.  </p>

<p>My dad helped me make this website because he wants me to practice writing. I’m going to write about my favourite books, films, and seafood noodle soup restaurants!</p>
