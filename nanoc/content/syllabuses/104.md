# Philosophy of Mind

Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Mind. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of *nearly* everything.

**GENERAL INFORMATION**    
Before writing your essay, you should try to read all of the Core Reading for the topic unless otherwise indicated. Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics, and you should use the Further Reading suggestions, in conjunction with the [Faculty Reading list](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/104%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20Oct%2010.pdf), in vacations to work on the topics that most interest you.

Plan your essay out **before** you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven't done any reading, so how can you plan out what you've got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.

In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week's topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.

**COURSE PLAN, TEXTBOOKS, ANTHOLOGIES**  
We will be looking at some contemporary approaches to the mind-body problem and some associated issues. There are no set textbooks, but I strongly recommend that you pick up a copy of Jaegwon Kim's *Philosophy of Mind*, 3rd ed. (Westview Press, 2010), which is an excellent introduction to the subject, written by one of its foremost theorists, and covers most of the topics we'll look at. (The exceptions are action and perception, which are only briefly discussed in chapter 7.) If you want to get hold of an anthology of classic papers in the subject, I particularly recommend David Chalmers, ed. (2002) *Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings* (OUP), which is referred to as **Chalmers** below.

## 1. THE TYPE-IDENTITY THEORY

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the type-identity theory, and what is the best argument for it? What problem does multiple realizability pose to the theory? Can it be met?  

**CORE READING**  
U\. T. Place (1956) '[Is Consciousness a Brain Process?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1956.tb00560.x/abstract)' in *British Journal of Psychology* 47, pp. 44-50. In **Chalmers**.  
J\. J. C. Smart (1962) '[Sensations and Brain Processes](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2182164)' in *Philosophical Review* 68(2), pp. 141-156. In **Chalmers**.  
David Lewis (1966) '[An Argument for the Identity Theory](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2024524)' in *Journal of Philosophy* 63(1), pp. 17-25. Reprinted in his (1983) *Philosophical Papers, Volume I* (OUP).     
Hilary Putnam (1967/1975) 'The Nature of Mental States' in his *Mind, Language and Reality* (CUP). In **Chalmers**. (Originally published as 'Psychological Predicates'.)  

For this week, it's enough to get a grasp of the multiple realizability objection that Putnam present in §III of his paper, but the rest of the paper is important for next week.

**FURTHER READING**  
Lewis (1980) and Kim (1992) respond to the multiple realizaility objection. Papineau (2002) presents a causal argument for the identity theory - an argument that we will re-encounter when we cover mental causation in more detail.  

David Lewis (1980) 'Mad Pain and Martian Pain' in N. Block, ed. *Readings in the Philosophy of Psychology* (MIT Press). Reprinted in Lewis (1983) *Philosophical Papers, Volume I* (OUP), and available [online](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/0195032047.001.0001/acprof-9780195032048-chapter-9).  
Jaegwon Kim (1992) '[Multiple Realization and the Metaphysics of Reduction](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2107741)' in *Philosophy and Phenomenological Research* 52(1), pp. 1-26.    
David Papineau (2002) *Thinking About Consciousness* (OUP), [Ch. 1](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/0199243824.001.0001/acprof-9780199243822-chapter-2).  

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
'In order to account for causal relations between the mental and the physical we must accept type-physicalism.' Discuss.

Is type identity theory the only defensible solution to the problem of mental causation?  

## 2. FUNCTIONALISM

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the difference between analytic or common sense functionalism and psychofunctionalism? Which is more plausible? Can Ned Block's objection that "no version of functionalism can avoid both liberalism and chauvinism" be met?  

**CORE READING**  
Janet Levin (2004/13) '[Functionalism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism)' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*.  
David Lewis (1972) '[Psycho-Physical and Theoretical Identifications](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048407212341301)' in *Australasian Journal of Philosophy* 50(3), pp. 249–258. Reprinted in his (1999) *Papers in Epistemology and Metaphysics* (CUP). In **Chalmers**.

Savage, ed. *Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science* 9, pp. 261-325. Reprinted in his (1997) *Consciousness, Function, and Representation: Collected Papers, Volume 1* (MIT Press). In **Chalmers**.

**FURTHER READING**  
For further reading on this topic, you could do a lot worse than follow up the debates between Block and Sidney Shoemaker over absent and inverted qualia. Shoemaker (1975) is a good way in, while his (1981) is a careful discussion of different forms of functionalism. Byrne (2004/15) is a detailed discussion of philosophical arguments, including Block's, that appeal to the possibility of spectral inversion.

Sidney Shoemaker (1975) '[Functionalism and Qualia](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF01225748)' in *Philosophical Studies* 27(5), pp. 291–315. Reprinted in his (2003) *Identity, Cause, and Mind*, 2nd edition (OUP).    
Sidney Shoemaker (1981) '[Some Varieties of Functionalism](http://ezproxy.ouls.ox.ac.uk:4014/collection/authorizedshow?id=philtopics_1981_0012_0001_0093_0119&pdfname=philtopics_1981_0012_0001_0093_0119.pdf&file_type=pdf)' in *Philosophical Topics* 12(1), pp. 93–119.

Interview with Ned Block: [http://philo.ruc.edu.cn/ceap/ned-block-what-is-functionalism/](http://philo.ruc.edu.cn/ceap/ned-block-what-is-functionalism/)

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
'Either we are functionalists or we are physicalists.' Discuss.

'Ontologically, analytical functionalism is similar to the identity theory; conceptually, it is similar to analytical behaviourism. It is open to objection on both counts.' Do you agree? 

## 3. KRIPKE'S OBJECTION

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is Kripke's objection to the type-identity theory? Is it a good one?

**CORE READING**  
Robert Kirk (2003/15) 'Zombies' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/).    
Saul Kripke (1971) '[Identity and Necessity](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199730155.001.0001/acprof-9780199730155-chapter-1)' in his (2011) collection *Philosophical Troubles* (OUP). Alternatively, try his (1980) *Naming and Necessity* (Blackwell), Ch. 3, which is reprinted in **Chalmers**.  
Christopher S. Hill (1997) '[Imaginability, Conceivability, Possibility and the Mind-Body Problem](http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1017911200883)' in *Philosophical Studies* 87(1), pp. 61–85. In **Chalmers**.    
David Chalmers (2009) '[The Two‐Dimensional Argument Against Materialism](http://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199262618.003.0019)' in A. Beckermann, B. P. McLaughlin, and S. Walter, eds. *The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mind* (OUP).  

You might want to leave the Chalmers for further reading, and focus on getting to grips with Kripke's argument.

**FURTHER READING**  
Chalmers' defence of a Kripke-style modal argument against materialism is very controversial, and much discussed. Chalmers' (2009) paper (listed above, and itself a cut-down version of a longer piece) responds to some of the many objections that have been made. Block and Stalnaker (1999) is a difficult but extremely interesting critical discussion. Chalmers and Jackson (2001) is a response.

Ned Block and Robert Stalnaker (1999) '[Conceptual Analysis, Dualism, and the Explanatory Gap](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2998259)' in *The Philosophical Review* 108(1), pp. 1–46. Reprinted in **Chalmers**.  
David Chalmers and Frank Jackson (2001) '[Conceptual Analysis and Reductive Explanation](http://philreview.dukejournals.org/content/110/3/315)' in *The Philosophical Review* 110(3), pp. 315–360.  

An interview with David Chalmers: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeDhaightUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeDhaightUU).

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
'The correspondence between a brain state and a mental state seems to have a certain obvious element of contingency.... [Ildentity is not a relation which can hold contingently between objects. Therefore, if the identity thesis were correct, the element of contingency would not lie in the relation between the mental and physical states.' (KRIPKE) Discuss.
Is the statement ‘pain state = brain state’ necessary and a posteriori? What, if anything, does this tell us about the identification of the mental and the physical?

## 4. THE EXPLANATORY GAP

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
'Even if *zombies* - creatures who are physically or functionally identical to us but lacking in consciousness - are not metaphysically possible, their conceivability would be enough to show that materialist theories of consciousness are inadequate.' Discuss.

**CORE READING**  
Joseph Levine (1983) '[Materialism and Qualia: the Explanatory Gap](http://www.umass.edu/philosophy/PDF/Levine/Gap.pdf)' in *Pacific Philosophical Quarterly* 64, pp. 354–361. Reprinted in **Chalmers**.  
Thomas Nagel (1974) '[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2183914)' in *The Philosophical Review*, 83(4), pp. 435–450. In **Chalmers**.    
Michael Tye (1999) '[Phenomenal Consciousness: The Explanatory Gap as a Cognitive Illusion](http://doi.org/10.1093/mind/108.432.705)' in *Mind* 108(432), pp. 705–725.

**FURTHER READING**  
Block and Stalnaker (1999), in last week's further reading, is also relevant this week. In addition, you might find these two relatively recent survey articles useful:

Joseph Levine (2009) '[The Explanatory Gap](http://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199262618.003.0017)' in A. Beckermann, B. P. McLaughlin, and S. Walter, eds. *The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mind* (OUP).   
Katalin Balog (2009) '[Phenomenal Concepts](http://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199262618.003.0018)' in A. Beckermann, B. P. McLaughlin, and S. Walter, eds. *The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mind* (OUP).  

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
'The identification of the qualitative side of pain with C-fiber firing (or some property of C-fiber firing) leaves the connection between it and what we identify it with completely mysterious.' (LEVINE) What, if anything, follows from this?

‘Even if every behavioural and cognitive function related to consciousness were explained, there would still remain a further mystery.’ (CHALMERS) Discuss.

## 5. PERCEPTION

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Can our ordinary conception of perceptual experience be reconciled with the possibility of perceptual illusion and hallucination? If not, how should we instead conceive of perceptual experience?

**CORE READING**  
Tim Crane and Craig French (2005/2015) 'The Problem of Perception' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-problem/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-problem/).

P\. F. Strawson (1979) '[Perception and its Objects](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587292.001.0001/acprof-9780199587292-chapter-11)' reprinted in his (2014) *Philosophical Writings* (OUP).

Optional extras, if you're feeling ambitious:

**FURTHER READING**  
The papers by Grice and Snowdon discuss the role of causation in perception. You can find them both, along with Strawson's paper and many other classic pieces on perception, in J. Dancy, ed. (1988) *Perceptual Knowledge* (OUP). Nudds' article is a very useful survey of contemporary work on naive realism.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Is the phenomenal character of perceptual experience transparent? If so, does this motivate a particular theory of perception?What motivates disjunctivist accounts of perception? Is this motivation as good as disjunctivists take it to be?


## 6. ACTION: REASONS and CAUSES
**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Why does Davidson think that rationalising explanations are causal explanations? Is he right?

**CORE READING**  
Timothy O'Connor (2010) 'Reasons and Causes' in Timothy O'Connor and Constantine Sandis, eds. *A Companion to the Philosophy of Action* (Blackwell). Available [online](http://www.oxford.eblib.com/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=496064). The contributions from Stout, Sehon, and Dretske, among others, are also very useful.

Donald Davidson (1963) '[Actions, Reasons, and Causes](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/0199246270.001.0001/acprof-9780199246274-chapter-1)' reprinted in his (2001) *Essays on Actions and Events*, 2nd ed. (OUP). See also the other essays in section  of this collection, *Intention and Action*, especially 'Agency' and 'Freedom to Act'.   
Harry Frankfurt (1978) '[The Problem of Action](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20009708)' in *American Philosophical Quarterly* 15(2), pp. 157-162.   
George Wilson (1985) 'Davidson on Intentional Action' in Ernie Lepore and Brian P. McLaughlin, eds. *Actions and Events: Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson* (Blackwell).  
Fred Dretske (1989) '[Reasons and Causes](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2214261?origin=crossref)' in *Philosophical Perspectives* 3, pp. 1-15.  

Davidson (1963) and Frankfurt (1978) can both be found in Alfred Mele, ed. (1997) *The Philosophy of Action* (OUP). The introduction to this collection, which contains many other classic readings, is an excellent overview of both this and other central issues in the philosophy of action.

**FURTHER READING**  
For an alternative treatment of the worry raised by Dretske - a worry that will come up again in future weeks - see Hornsby (1993). Velleman (1992) argues that Davidson's account does not make sufficient allowance for the fact that agents are paradigmatically the causes of their actions. Setiya (2003) replies to this and other objections.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Can a rationalising explanation of a person’s action also be a causal explanation?
What role does the notion of causation play in explanations of intention or of action?


## 7. ANOMALOUS MONISM
**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is anomalous monism?  What are Davidson's arguments against psycho-physical laws? Does Davidson's account of mental causation render mental properties epiphenomenal?

**CORE READING**  
Julie Yoo (2009) '[Anomalous Monism](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2067/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199262618.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199262618-e-6)' in B. McLaughlin, A. Beckermann, and S. Walter, eds. *The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mind* (OUP).

Various philosophers interview Donald Davidson (see especially the interviews by Martin Davies and Tim Crane): [https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/30455b15-877e-49a6-a569-14bce5b06d25/dvds-philosophy.html](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/30455b15-877e-49a6-a569-14bce5b06d25/dvds-philosophy.html)

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘The problem with Davidson’s anomalous monism is that it has the consequence that it is only qua physical events that mental events have physical consequences. The mental properties of mental events are epiphenomenal.’ Is this a consequence of anomalous monism? Is it a problem?
Does anomalous monism lead to epiphenomenalism?
