# Philosophy of Mind

Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Mind. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of *nearly* everything.

I have divided the reading for each topic into **CORE READING** and **FURTHER READING**, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the [Faculty Reading List](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/104%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20Oct%2010.pdf). 

The default plan is to cover the **TUTORIAL TOPICS**, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the **OTHER TOPICS**.

**TUTORIAL TOPICS**

1. [The Type-Identity Theory](#type-identity)
2. [Functionalism](#functionalism)
3. [Zombies](#zombies) <!--absent qualia-->  
4. [Perception](#perception)
5. [Action: Reasons and Causes](#action)
6. [Anomalous Monism](#anomalous_monism)
7. [Self-Deception](#self-deception)
8. [Mental Causation](#mental_causation)

**OTHER TOPICS**  

- Naturalizing Content
- Internalism and Externalism
- Other Minds
- Self-Knowledge

<!--
2. [Eliminativism]
4. [Subjectivity] nagel, qualia, inverted spectrum, dennett

**ANTHOLOGIES and TEXTBOOKS**

David Chalmers, ed. (2002) *Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings* (OUP), referred to as **Chalmers** below, contains many of the papers you'll need. There are no set textbooks, but I strongly recommend that you pick up a copy of Jaegwon Kim's *Philosophy of Mind*, 3rd ed. (Westview Press, 2011), which is an excellent introduction to the subject, written by one of its foremost theorists, and covers most of the topics we'll look at. (The exceptions are action and perception, which are only briefly discussed in chapter 7.) Also recommended are:

- David Braddon-Mitchell and Frank Jackson (2006) *Philosophy of Mind and Cognition* (Blackwell)
- Tim Crane (2001) *Elements of Mind* (OUP)
- John Heil (2013) *Philosophy of Mind: A Contemporary Introduction*, 3rd edition (Routledge)

## 1. THE TYPE-IDENTITY THEORY
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the type-identity theory, and what is the best argument for it? What problem does multiple realizability pose to the theory? Can it be met?  

**CORE READING**

For this week, it's enough to get a grasp of the multiple realizability objection that Putnam present in §III of his paper, but the rest of the paper is important for next week.

**FURTHER READING**  
Lewis (1980) and Kim (1992) respond to the multiple realizability objection. Papineau (2002) presents a causal argument for the identity theory - an argument that we will re-encounter when we cover mental causation in more detail in 8th week.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘In order to account for causal relations between the mental and the physical we must accept type-physicalism.’ Discuss. (2013)

Is the mere multiple realizability of psychological kinds a good objection to thecentral state identity theory? (2012)
 
Is type identity theory the only defensible solution to the problem of mental causation? (2009)  

<!-- NOTES

What is the identity theory?

Starting point: for each mental event (state?) type/kind M, there is a corresponding physical event (state?) type/kind P.

The correspondence seems to be (a) lawlike and (b) such that no mental change without a physical change (supervenience).

[Is this right? Not obviously: Davidson will challenge (a), at least.]

How to explain the correspondences?

(1) causal interactionism between distinct kinds of substance (Descartes)
(2) pre-established harmony between them (Leibniz)
(3) dual aspects of a single underlying substance (Spinoza)
(4) epiphenomenalism (Huxley)
(5) emergentism (Samuel Alexander)
(6) identity: mental event (state) types are identical to corresponding physical event (state) types.

We discovered that lightning is a certain sort of electrical discharge; analogously, on (6), pain is the firing of C-fibres.

---

What arguments are there for the identity theory?

(A) Simplicity arguments (Smart)

1. Identification of mental and physical types/kinds reduces the number of entities. 
[Why reduction rather than elimination?]
2. Identification is conceptually/linguistically simpler. 
[So what? Completeness of physical vocabulary.]
3. Identification *explains* correspondence. 
[But we still have the same number of basic assumptions, so how's this an advantage? Suggests that it's rather...]

(B) Explanatory arguments

1. Best explanation of correlations.

[Supposing it does explain the correlations, is type-identity the *best* explanation? Big issue. But it doesn't even explain them. Consider: "Why does pain, not itchiness, correlate with c-fibres firing? Because pain is identical to c-fibres firing." We're edging towards the explanatory gap.

Also: it turns the alleged explananda into trivialities -- pain is pain. Elsewhere in science, to explain a correlation, we either derive it from a more basic law, or show the correlated phenomena are effects of a common case. And elsewhere, explanations are *fruitful*. This one isn't.]

2, Best explanation of otherwise unexplained facts about mentality (Block and Stalnaker), e.g. why pain causes distress. Pain = CFF; Distress = neural state N; CFF causes neural state N; so pain causes distress.

[Kim seems to think this is no better than the previous argument. What's doing the explanatory work, he thinks, is a certain neurological fact. But this doesn't seem so convincing. I might ask: why does heat melt ice? And I might be given the answer, heat is molecular movement, and blah blah. That looks pretty explanatory to me! So why is it any different in the mental case?]

(C) Causal arguments

## 2. FUNCTIONALISM
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the difference between analytic or common-sense functionalism and psychofunctionalism? Which is more plausible? Can Ned Block's objection that "no version of functionalism can avoid both liberalism and chauvinism" be met?

**FURTHER READING**  
For further reading on this topic, you could do a lot worse than follow up the debates between Block and Sidney Shoemaker over absent and inverted qualia. Shoemaker (1975) is a good way in, while his (1981) is a careful discussion of different forms of functionalism. Byrne (2004/15) is a detailed discussion of philosophical arguments, including Block's, that appeal to the possibility of spectral inversion.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘Functionalism gives an accurate account of the propositional attitudes. But its attempts to account for experiences and sensations are a failure.’ Do you agree? (2016)

‘Functionalism is the best theory of the mind we currently have.’ Do you agree? (2015)

‘Ontologically, analytical functionalism is similar to the identity theory; conceptually, it is similar to analytical behaviourism. It is open to objection on both counts.’ Do you agree? (2014)

## 3. ZOMBIES
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Are *zombies* &mdash; creatures who are physically or functionally identical to us but lacking in consciousness &mdash; conceivable? If so, what problems, if any, does this pose for type-identity and functionalist theories of the mind?

**CORE READING**  
\*Robert Kirk (2003/15) 'Zombies' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/).

**FURTHER READING**  
Chalmers (2009) presents his influential Kripke-style modal argument against materialism, and responds to many of the objections that have pressed against it. Block and Stalnaker (1999) is a difficult, but extremely interesting critical discussion of both Levine's and Chalmer's arguments. Balog (2009) is a state of the art piece on the so-called *phenomenal concepts* strategy for defending materialism, which may be familiar to you from 1st year work on Frank Jackson's Knowledge Argument.

Strawson (1979) argues that perceptual experiences strike us as involving the presentation of mind-independent objects. Harman (1990) argues for a closely related thesis, called *transparency* &mdash; roughly, that perceptual experiences don't strike us as involving awareness of experiences themselves, but only of their mind-independent objects &mdash; and defends an intentionalist position akin to Anscombe's. Martin (2002) is a critical discussion of the issue from a naive realist perspective. Nudds (2009) surveys recent work on naive realism.

(a) is perceptual experience partly constituted by mind-independent objects and properties?
(b) is it partly constituted by the *particular* M-I object one sees and its properties?

The introduction to this collection, which contains many other classic readings, is an excellent overview of both this and other central issues in the philosophy of action.

**FURTHER READING**  
Frankfurt (1978) criticises causal accounts of action on the grounds that action involves (the capacity for) ongoing guidance of movement. Hornsby (1993) provides an alternative treatment of the problem discussed by Dretske. Velleman (1992) argues that Davidson's account does not make sufficient allowance for the fact that agents are paradigmatically the causes of their actions. Setiya (2003) replies to this and other objections.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Can anomalous monism do justice to the causal relevance of mental properties? (2016)Is it consistent to maintain that the mental supervenes on the physical, while denying that there are any psycho-physical laws? (2015)‘The problem with Davidson’s anomalous monism is that it has the consequence that it is only qua physical events that mental events have physical consequences. The mental properties of mental events are epiphenomenal.’ Is this a consequence of anomalous monism? Is it a problem? (2014)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Is there anything more to having a mind than being interpretable as if one had one?

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘The claim that human beings have beliefs, desires, and intentions is a useful fiction. But it isn’t literally true.’ Discuss. (2016)

‘What it is to be a ... believer is to be an intentional system, a system whose behaviour is reliably and voluminously predictable via the intentional strategy.’ (DENNETT) Is this correct? (2015)

‘The correctness of propositional attitude attributions consists in this: that they contribute to the best possible interpretation of people – that is, the interpretation that makes the best sense possible of the people’s total life and conduct.’ Discuss. (2014)

What would it be to naturalize intentionality? Why might one want to do so? (2012)

Can those who propose to naturalize mental content adequately account for the normativity of the mental? (2010)

<!-- 
INTERNALISM and EXTERNALISM

‘Anne’s Twin Earth doppelgänger is a physical replica of Anne. So there can be no causal difference between them. But if there is no causal difference between them, there can be no mental difference either. So externalism about content is false.’ Discuss. (2016)

What role, if any, does a subject’s socio-linguistic environment play in fixing the content of her propositional attitudes? (2015)

‘Broadmindedness [externalism about mental content] must deny either that intentional states as such have causes and effects or that relational properties cannot have immediate effects.’ (CRANE) Discuss. (2014)

Are there any reasons to think that the content of some mental states depends constitutively on the linguistic practices of society? (2013)

SELF-KNOWLEDGE

‘I get myself in a position to answer the question whether I believe that p by putting into operation whatever procedure I have for answering the question whether p.’ (EVANS) Does this observation point to a satisfying explanation of our knowledge of our own mental states? (2016)

How, if at all, can externalism about mental content be reconciled with first- person authority concerning our own beliefs and other propositional attitudes? (2014)

‘Mental self-knowledge involves no substantial cognitive achievement, it is merely an artefact of the grammar of mental concepts.’ Discuss. (2013)

'Each of us is especially authoritative about our own experiences and mental states, but there is no faculty of introspection.' Discuss. (2010)

OTHER MINDS 

Is our knowledge of other people’s mental properties a form of perceptual knowledge? (2016)

‘We routinely speak about seeing that there are some people in the waiting room, passengers on the bus, students in the office, and a crowd of people listening to the speaker. If what we routinely say is true, if we do see this sort of thing, then this is how we know (or, at least, one of the ways we know), that there are other minds.’ (DRETSKE) Discuss. (2014) 
Compare and contrast two approaches to the epistemological problem of other minds. (2013)

Does inference to the best explanation provide a plausible solution to the problem of other minds? (2012)
