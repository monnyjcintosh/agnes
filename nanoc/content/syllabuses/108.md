# Philosophy of Logic and Language

Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Logic and Language. Many of the readings are online, and easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of *nearly* everything. 

I have divided the reading for each topic into **CORE READING** and **FURTHER READING**, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the [Faculty Reading List](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/108%20Philosophy%20of%20Logic%20and%20Language.pdf). 

The default plan is to cover the **TUTORIAL TOPICS**, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the **OTHER TOPICS**. (I've also listed some **ADVANCED TOPICS**, which presuppose some familiarity with other topics, and which some students have wanted to explore. These are less likely to come up in exams.)

## 1. FREGE: SENSE and REFERENCE
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Why did Frege distinguish between sense (Sinn) and reference (Bedeutung)? Was he right to do so?

**CORE READING**  
\*Mark Textor (2011) [*Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Frege on Sense and Reference*](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/oxford/detail.action?docID=574675) (Routledge), esp. Ch. 4.  

Gottlob Frege (1892) 'On *Sinn* and *Bedeutung*' in Michael Beaney, ed. (1997) *The Frege Reader* (Blackwell). Also in **B&K**, **Harnish**, **Ludlow**, **Martinich**, and **Moore**.  
Nathan Salmon (1986) *Frege's Puzzle* (MIT Press). Selections reprinted in **B&K**, **Harnish** and **Martinich**.  
William Taschek (2010) 'On Sense and Reference: a Critical Reception' in Michael Potter and Tom Ricketts, eds. [*The Cambridge Companion to Frege*](https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:4563/10.1017/CCOL9780521624282) (CUP).  

Note: you won't have time to read all of Salmon (1986). Go for one of the excerpted selections in **B&K**, **Harnish** and **Martinich**.  

**FURTHER READING**  
Other essential pieces by Frege include 'Function and Concept' and 'Thought'. Both are in Michael Beaney, ed. (1997) *The Frege Reader* (Blackwell) &mdash; and 'Thought' is widely anthologised. Contemporary discussion of Frege has been dominated by Michael Dummett's writings, especially his magisterial (1981); chapter 5 discusses the sense-reference distinction. Burge's writings on Frege, collected in his (2005), are no less essential, and more sensitive to textual and historical considerations. Part II focuses on sense and cognitive value, though perhaps the best place to start is 'Frege on Truth', first published in 1986, in Part I. McDowell (1977) is another essential piece. Gray (2017) is an introduction to an interesting alternative to Frege's approach, associated with Kit Fine. Michael Kremer's contribution to the same volume as Taschek's above is very helpful, as is Heck and May (2008).

## 2. RUSSELL: DEFINITE DESCRIPTIONS
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Are definite descriptions referring expressions, quantifier expressions, or something else?  

**CORE READING**

**FURTHER READING**  
Kripke (1977) is a must-read, defending a broadly Russellian position. Neale (1990) is an influential exposition and defence of Kripke's position. Strawson's approach has seen a recent revival, especially among linguists &mdash; von Fintel (2004) is a prominent example of this trend. The topic is a key battleground in debates over the semantics/pragmatics distinction; Recanati (1993) and Stanley and Szabó (2000) are two key contributions.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
What, if anything, is the meaning of the word ‘the’? (2016)

Do sentences such as 'The present King of France is bald' cast doubt on the principle that every well-formed sentence is either true or false? (2015)

Suppose that Jane is the only person in the world who plays professional football and is from Greenland. What, if anything, is the difference between saying ‘Jane lives in the UK’ and ‘The professional football player from Greenland lives in the UK’? (2014)

## 3. KRIPKE: NAMING and NECESSITY
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What are Kripke's arguments against the descriptive theories of meaning and reference? Are they successful? What is the causal theory of reference? Is it defensible?

**CORE READING**  
\*Harold Noonan (2013) *Routledge Guidebook to Kripke and Naming and Necessity* (Routledge), Ch. 3. Available online [here](https://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:4099/lib/oxford/detail.action?docID=1687343).

**FURTHER READING**  
Stanley (1997) adapts a line of reasoning pressed against Kripke in Dummett (1981). (Dummett's objection is quite different to Stanley's, however.) Jackson (1998) responds to Kripke's modal argument by arguing that names are abbreviations of so-called actualised descriptions. Jeshion (2002) is a response to Kripke's epistemological argument. Soames (2002) discusses a wide range of different responses to Kripke, and would be an excellent place to start in pursuing this topic in more depth. Burgess (2014) critically discusses Evans' challenge to the causal theory of reference.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Does ‘Socrates’ mean the same as ‘the actual F’, for some expression ‘F’? (2016)

Suppose that twins Sarah and Lisa are accidentally swapped as babies after their parents have named them both. Unbeknowst to anyone, the child originally named ‘Sarah’ grows up being called ‘Lisa’ and the child originally named ‘Lisa’ grows up being called ‘Sarah’. Must the causal theory of reference predict that ‘Sarah’ refers to the child everyone calls ‘Lisa’ and vice versa? (2015)

Do proper names and definite descriptions ever mean the same thing? (2012)



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<a name="empty_names"></a>

## 4. EMPTY NAMES
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What problems do apparently empty names pose for accounts of proper names? How are they best solved?

**CORE READING**  
\*Sarah Sawyer (2012) 'Empty Names' in Delia Graff Fara and Gillian Russell, eds. *The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Language* (Routledge).  

Saul Kripke (2013) [*Reference and Existence*](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199928385.001.0001/acprof-9780199928385) (OUP), pp. 3-78 and pp. 144-60.

**FURTHER READING**  
Salmon (1998), Thomasson (2003), and Braun (2005) offer views with many affinities with Kripke's. It is well worth working through the details of these, and the ways in which they differ from one another and Kripke. Ray (2014) is an interesting recent paper, arguing that the problems posed by (genuinely) empty names have a surprisingly straightforward solution. As he explains, the solution he puts forward is superficially similar to Sainsbury's, but makes no use of free logic. Textor (2016) is a survey piece on approaches to empty (or "vacuous") names in early analytic philosophy.

## 5. IMPLICATURES
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
How, if at all, should we distinguish between what a speaker *says* in uttering a sentence and the *conversational implicatures* of her utterance? Is there any need for a further category of *conventional* implicature?

**FURTHER READING**  
Travis (1991) and Neale (1992) are two contrasting surveys of Grice's work. Broadly speaking, Travis is critical and Neale sympathetic. Conventional implicatures have long been viewed with suspicion. Karttunen and Peters (1979) argued that they are simply presuppositions, and Carston (2002) (among other things) presents a relevance-theoretic case against them. But Christopher Potts has recently argued for the need for a separate category of conventional implicatures. See his (2007), which condenses themes from his earlier book.

**FURTHER READING**  
In pursuing this topic in any depth, Kratzer (1986) is essential, arguing that "if" is not a two-place connective, but rather a device for restricting the domains of certain operators. Bennett (2001) is an even-minded book-length discussion of all the issues. Block (2008) responds on Stalnaker's behalf to Edgington's objections against his view. Douven (2011) and Gillies (2017) are introductory pieces &mdash; the latter discussing counterfactual as well as indicative conditionals.

‘When A is true and B is false, “If A then B” is definitely false. Also, from “not-A or B” we can infer “If A then B”, which shows that whenever A is false or B is true, “If A then B” is true. This proves that the indicative conditional must be a truth- functional connective.’ Is that so? (2015)

Do conditionals have truth-conditions? (2014)

## 8. CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What problems, if any, does context-sensitivity pose for the idea that the truth-conditions of sentences are determined by the meanings of their parts and the ways that they are put together? What implications does your answer have for the distinction between semantics and pragmatics?

**FURTHER READING**  
Sainsbury (2001) is an underappreciated gem, demonstrating the range of options available to formal semanticists aiming to accommodate Travis's examples. The remaining papers all concede that truth-conditions are radically context-sensitive, though all except one argue that this can be accommodated within the framework of truth-conditional semantics that we've been working with over the past few weeks. The exception is Carston (2008), which offers a Relevance Theoretic perspective.

Sher (1999) discusses both Field's and other challenges to Tarski. Heck (1997) discusses the connection between Tarskian definitions of truth taken as, roughly, theories specifying the meanings of the sentences of the object-language and as theories of what 'true' means in the metalanguage.

## ASSERTORIC CONTENT AND INGREDIENT SENSE
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**

Mackay (2013) argues for "monsters", or context-shifting operators.
