# Early Modern Philosophy

Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Early Modern. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of *nearly* everything.

**GENERAL INFORMATION**  
The readings are divided into Primary and Secondary Literature. In writing your essays, you won't necessarily get through everything, but unless otherwise indicated, you should try to read **all** of the Primary Literature specified from the set texts (see below for these) and **most** of the Secondary Literature. (Items marked \*\* are introductory, and good places to start.) Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics. To be able to do this, you should follow up anything you missed in the vacation. You are also encouraged to use other resources, such as the [Faculty Reading list](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/101%20History%20of%20Philosophy%20from%20Descartes%20to%20Kant.pdf), for further suggestions.

Plan your essay out **before** you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven't done any reading, so how can you plan out what you've got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.

In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week's topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.


**COURSE PLAN, TEXTBOOKS, ANTHOLOGIES**  
The set texts are Descartes' *Meditations*, Spinoza's *Ethics*, Leibniz's *Discourse on Metaphysics* and *Monadology*, Locke's *Essay Concerning Human Understanding*, Berkeley's *Principles of Human Knowledge* and *Three Dialogues*, and Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature* (Book 1), though in some cases other texts are also useful. Various editions of these are available, many of them excellent. I particularly recommend the following: 

Descartes: *The Philosophical Writings of Descartes*, Vol. I and II, trans. and ed. by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, and Dugald Murdoch (CUP, 1985), abbreviated as **CSM** below; *Selected Philosophical Writings of Descartes*, trans. and ed. by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, and Dugald Murdoch (CUP, 1988), abbreviated as **SPW** below.

Spinoza: *A Spinoza Reader*, trans. and ed. by Edwin Curley (Princeton 1994).

Leibniz: *Philosophical Texts*, Oxford Philosophical Texts edition, trans. and ed. by R. S. Woolhouse and Richard Francks (OUP, 1998).

Berkeley: *A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge*, Oxford Philosophical Texts edition, ed. by Jonathan Dancy (OUP, 1998); *Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous*, Oxford Philosophical Texts edition, ed. by Jonathan Dancy (OUP, 1998).  

Hume: *A Treatise of Human Nature*, Oxford Philosophical Texts edition, ed. by David Fate Norton and Mary J. Norton (OUP, 2000).


## 1. DESCARTES' PROJECT and the COGITO

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is Descartes trying to achieve with his Meditations? What are his principal objectives and conclusions? What function do the sceptical arguments play, and how does Descartes attempt to answer them? What is the intended role of the Cogito, and what is it about the Cogito that makes it suitable for this role? Is Descartes’ procedure viable, at least in principle?

**PRIMARY LITERATURE**  
Descartes: *Letter to the Sorbonne* (**CSM** II, 3-6); *Synopsis of First Meditation* (**CSM** II, 9 & **SPW** 73); *First Meditation* (**CSM** II, 12-15 & **SPW** 76-79); *Principles of Philosophy* Pt. 1, §§1-6 (**CSM** I, 193-94 & **SPW** 160-61); *Objections and Replies* on Meditation One (**SPW** 123-26).  

*Synopsis of Second Meditation* (**CSM** II, 9-10 & **SPW** 73-74); *Second Meditation* (**CSM** II, 16-23 & **SPW** 80-86) and first few paragraphs of *Third Meditation* (**CSM** II, 24 & **CSM** 87); *Discourse on the Method* IV (**CSM** I, 126-27, & **SPW** 35-36); *Objections and Replies* concerning the Cogito (**SPW** 126-31).  

**SECONDARY LITERATURE**

## 2. THE CARTESIAN CIRCLE

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
“I cannot but admit that it would be easy for [God], if he so desired, to bring it about that I go wrong even in those matters which I think I see utterly clearly with my mind’s eye.” (*Third Meditation*, **CSM** p. 25). How does Descartes seek to allay this reason for doubt, and is his attempt damagingly circular?

**PRIMARY LITERATURE**  
Descartes: *Third Meditation* (**CSM** II, 24-36 esp. 24-25 & **SPW** 86-98 esp. 86-88); *Fifth Meditation* (**CSM** II, 44-49 esp. 47-49 & **SPW** 105-10 esp. 108-10); *Objections and Replies* on clear and distinct perception and the Cartesian circle (**SPW**, 139-43).
