# Ethics

Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Ethics. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of *nearly* everything.

**GENERAL INFORMATION**  
Before writing your essay, you should try to read all of the Core Reading for the topic unless otherwise indicated. Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics, and you should use the Further Reading suggestions, in conjunction with the [Faculty Reading list](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/103%20Ethics%20Nov%2009.pdf), in vacations to work on the topics that most interest you.

Plan your essay out **before** you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven't done any reading, so how can you plan out what you've got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.

In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week's topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.

**COURSE PLAN, TEXTBOOKS, ANTHOLOGIES**  
We'll focus particularly on Hume and Kant for much of the course. The key works are Hume's *A Treatise of Human Nature* (1738/1740) and *An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals* (1751) and Kant's *Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals* (1785). I recommend the Oxford Philosophical Texts editions of these, though most other scholarly editions will do just as well. I'll sometimes suggest other works in early modern philosophy. You'll generally find the pieces you need in one or the other of the following anthologies:

D\. D. Raphael, ed. (1969) *British Moralists, 1650-1800, Vol. I and II* (OUP).  
J. B. Schneewind, ed. (2003) *Moral Philosophy from Montaigne to Kant* (CUP).

I refer to these as **Raphael** and **Schneewind** below.

There are no set textbooks, but the order and choice of topics is loosely based on David Wiggins' excellent *Ethics: Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality* (Penguin, 2006). Chapters of this are suggested in connection with certain topics below, and it will also be helpful to read it all when you look back over the material at the end of term.
