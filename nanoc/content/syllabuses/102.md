# Knowledge & Reality

Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge & Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of *nearly* everything.

**GENERAL INFORMATION**  
Before writing your essay, you should try to read all of the Core Reading for the topic unless otherwise indicated. Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics, and you should use the Further Reading suggestions, in conjunction with the [Faculty Reading list](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf), in vacations to work on the topics that most interest you.

Plan your essay out **before** you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven't done any reading, so how can you plan out what you've got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.

In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week's topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.

**COURSE PLAN, TEXTBOOKS, ANTHOLOGIES**  
Many of the readings for the first three topics are in E\. Sosa, J. Kim, J. Fantl, and M. McGrath, eds. (2008) *Epistemology: An Anthology*, 2nd ed. (Blackwell). I refer to this as **SKF&M** below.  

## 1. THE ANALYSIS of KNOWLEDGE
**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Are there any compelling reasons for thinking that knowledge cannot be analysed?

**CORE READING**

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘It’s too easy to come up with counterexamples to putative analyses of knowledge in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so we should abandon the attempt to construct such analyses.’ Is this a compelling argument? And should we give up the project of analysing knowledge?‘The theory that knowledge is justified true belief is a simple and powerful proposal. Just as we accept simple and powerful, but highly counterintuitive, theories in fundamental physics, so too we may accept the knowledge proposal despite its counterintuitive consequences.’ Discuss.  
## 2. KNOWLEDGE and MODALITY: EPISTEMIC CLOSURE
**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Is knowledge closed under known entailment?

**CORE READING**  
Steven Luper (2001/2010) 'The Epistemic Closure Principle' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/closure-epistemic/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/closure-epistemic/).

Apart from the SEP article, all of these (and the Vogel below) are reprinted in **SKF&M**. I strongly recommend that you read the reprint of the Nozick, which abridges the extremely long original. See also §5 of the SEP article in last week's reading, which gives you a very brief overview.

(Originally published in 2005.)  

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Can one know that one has hands without being in a position to know that one is not a handless brain in a vat? Why might the issue seem important?  

Suppose that I would still believe P, were P false. Does it follow that I do not in fact know that P?  

## 3. EPISTEMIC CONTEXTUALISM
**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is epistemic contextualism and how does it differ from subject-sensitive invariantism? Is it true?

**CORE READING**  
Patrick Rysiew (2007/2011) 'Epistemic Contextualism' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contextualism-epistemology/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contextualism-epistemology/)

Again, apart from the SEP article, all of these (and the MacFarlane below) are reprinted in **SKF&M**. (Hawthorne's chapter is reprinted under the title 'Sensitive Moderate Invariantism'.)

**FURTHER READING**  
Keith DeRose (2009) *[The Case for Contextualism](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199564460.001.0001/acprof-9780199564460?rskey=QwKQzT&result=1)* (OUP).

John MacFarlane (2005) '[The Assessment Sensitivity of Knowledge Attributions](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/bodleian/reader.action?docID=10177960&ppg=210)' in Tamar Szábo Gendler and John Hawthorne, eds. *Oxford Studies in Epistemology*, Volume 1 (OUP), pp. 197–233.   

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Are there any reasons to think that ‘know’ is context-sensitive, other than its potentially affording a response to scepticism?

‘When S knows that p, that is a non-linguistic fact about S’s mental state. That fact will obtain regardless of the linguistic context, and, hence, S will know that p in every such context. So epistemic contextualism is false.’ Discuss.

## 4. EXISTENCE

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Are there any individuals that do not exist?

**CORE READING**  
Michael Nelson (2012) 'Existence' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existence/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existence/).   

Bertrand Russell (1918) 'The Philosophy Of Logical Atomism', Lectures 5 and 6.       
W\. V. O. Quine (1948) 'On What There Is' reprinted in his (1980) *From a Logical Point of View* (Harvard UP, 2nd edition, revised).

Amie Thomasson (2009) 'Fictional Objects' in J. Kim, E. Sosa and S. Rosencrantz, eds. *A Companion to Metaphysics* (Blackwell, 2nd edition), pp. 10-18.  

Along with Carnap's paper below, the first three papers are reprinted - Russell's lectures under the title 'Existence and Description' - in Part I of J. Kim and Sosa, eds. (1999) *Metaphysics: An Anthology* (Blackwell).

**FURTHER READING**  
Quine's paper is the first salvo in a famous debate with Carnap. Carnap (1950) was the response, which in turn prompted Quine's famous 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism'. Quine was long regarded as having won the day, but the issue is now seen as less clear cut, owing at least in part to Yablo (1998), which discusses the debate and defends Carnap. Van Inwagen (1998) is a clear statement and defence of the Quinean position. Berto and Plebani's (2015) book is an accessible overview of work on this topic, defending the Quinean position - which they call the Standard View.
 
Rudolf Carnap (1950) 'Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology' in *Revue Internationale de Philosophie* 4, pp. 20-40. Reprinted in his *Meaning and Necessity* (University of Chicago Press, 2nd edition).

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘Existence is a property like any other.’ Discuss.

Are ontological disputes merely verbal disputes over the choice of conventional linguistic framework?

## 5. POSSIBLE WORLDS

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is a possible world, and what reasons might there be for us to believe in possible worlds other than the actual one?

**CORE READING**  
Christopher Menzel (2013) 'Possible Worlds' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/).

Gideon Rosen (1990) '[Modal Fictionalism](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2255102)' in *Mind* 99(395), pp. 327–354.

**FURTHER READING**  
If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the first three chapters of David Lewis's (1986) book are essential reading. The first lays out a case for his brand of modal realism, the second defends it from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. Melia (1992) argues against modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Sider (2003) discusses various reductive accounts of modality, including Lewis's. Bricker and Melia (2008) defend concretism and ersatzism respectively.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
'It is possible for there to be a blue swan; therefore there is a blue swan in some possible world; therefore there is a blue swan.' Discuss.

'The world is not a possible world.' Is this true according to the best account of modality?


## 6. TRANSWORLD IDENTITY

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Can the fact that Ruqia could have been a doctor be understood in terms of the properties that Ruqia herself has in other possible worlds? Can it be understood in terms of the properties that counterparts of Ruqia have in other possible worlds?

**CORE READING**  
Penelope Mackie and Mark Jago (2006/13) 'Transworld Identity' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-transworld/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-transworld/).

Saul Kripke (1980) *Naming and Necessity* (Blackwell), pp. 16-20 and 44-47.  
 
**FURTHER READING**  
Forbes (1985) argues that unless things have non-trivial individual essences, transworld identities will be problematically ungrounded. Lewis (1986) discusses his counterpart theory in more detail. Fara and Williamson (2005) argues against it. (Be warned: this paper is quite technical.) Fine (1994) discusses something related to issues of transworld identity, arguing that facts about an object's essential properties cannot be understood in terms of facts about its modal properties (such as its having that property in every possible world), but rather vice-versa: facts abouts its modal properties have to be understood in terms of its essential properties.

Kit Fine (1994) '[Essence and Modality](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2214160)' in *Philosophical Perspectives* 8, pp. 1–16.  

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Could two distinct possible situations be qualitatively identical, differing only by permutation of their inhabitants?

'No individual exists in more than one possible world, so possible worlds are of no use in accounting for possibility and necessity claims concerning particular individuals.' Discuss.

## 7. TIME and TENSE

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is McTaggart’s paradox? What, if anything, does it tell us about the nature of time?

**CORE READING**  
Barry Dainton (2010) *[Time and Space](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/bodleian/detail.action?docID=10553842)*, 2nd edition (Acumen), Ch. 1 and 2.

Along with the article by Lewis below, the first three of these are reprinted in Tim Crane and Katalin Farkas, eds. (2004) *Metaphysics: A Guide and Anthology* (OUP).  
	
**FURTHER READING**  
Dainton (2010) is excellent overview of the main issues. Zimmerman and Smart (2008) is a recent debate. Zimmerman defends presentism, a view most closely associated with Prior, while Smart, like Horwich, defends the B-theory. Fine (2006) is difficult but rewards the effort, arguing for the reality of tense. Lewis (1976) is a defence of the possibility of backwards time travel. 

Barry Dainton (2010) *[Time and Space](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/bodleian/detail.action?docID=10553842)*, 2nd edition (Acumen), Ch. 3 to 8.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
In what, if anything, does the flow of time consist?

'There is nothing metaphysically special about the present.' Discuss.

## 8. PERSISTENCE OVER TIME

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the problem of temporary intrinsics? What is the best solution to it?

**CORE READING**  
Katherine Hawley (2004/15) 'Temporal Parts' in E. Zalta, *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/).

**FURTHER READING**  
This week's topic interestingly relates to last week's. Zimmerman (1998) defends a presentist solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics. Hawthorne (2008) is a very useful discussion, distinguishing the question of whether objects *have* temporal parts with different properties from the question of whether objects change over time *because* they have temporal parts with different properties, opening up the prospect of a four-dimensionalist endurantism. Thomson (1983) and Olson (2006) discuss another puzzle related to persistence over time: the issue of how objects can gain or lose parts over time.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
How, if at all, do ordinary physical objects persist?

Is the phenomenon of change of properties over time any more puzzling than the variation of temperature along the length of an iron bar?

## PERCEPTION

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Can our ordinary conception of perceptual experience be reconciled with the possibility of perceptual illusion and hallucination? If not, how should we instead conceive of perceptual experience?

The papers by Grice and Snowdon discuss the role of causation in perception. You can find them both, along with Strawson's paper and many other classic pieces on perception, in J. Dancy, ed. (1988) *Perceptual Knowledge* (OUP). Nudds' article is a very useful survey of contemporary work on naive realism.

## INDUCTION

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is induction? What is Hume's problem of induction? What do you think is the most promising response to it? Does Goodman's "New Riddle" add anything to the problem?
