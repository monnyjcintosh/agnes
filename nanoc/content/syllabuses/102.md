# Knowledge & Reality

Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge & Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of *nearly* everything. 

I have divided the reading for each topic into **CORE READING** and **FURTHER READING**, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the [Faculty Reading List](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf). 

The default plan is to cover the **TUTORIAL TOPICS**, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the **OTHER TOPICS**.

**TUTORIAL TOPICS**

1. [The Analysis of Knowledge](#analysis_of_knowledge)
2. [Epistemic Closure](#epistemic_closure)
3. [Epistemic Contextualism](#epistemic_contextualism)
4. [A Priori Knowledge](#a_priori)
5. [Possible Worlds](#possible_worlds)
6. [Causation](#causation)
7. [Time](#time)
8. [Persistence](#persistence)

**OTHER TOPICS**  

- [Induction](#induction)
- [Testimony](#testimony)
- [Epistemic Injustice](#epistemic_injustice) 
- [Personal Identity](#personal_identity)
- [Existence](#existence)
- [Transworld Identity](#transworld_identity)

**ANTHOLOGIES and TEXTBOOKS**  

The following anthologies are particularly useful, and contain many of the key readings. I refer to them below as **SKF&M** and **KK&S** respectively. 

- Ernest Sosa, Jaegwon Kim, Jeremy Fantl, and Matthew McGrath, eds. (2008) *Epistemology: An Anthology*, 2nd ed. (Blackwell).  
- Jaegwon Kim, Daniel Korman, and Ernest Sosa, eds. (2009) *Metaphysics: An Anthology*, 2nd ed. (Blackwell).

There are no set textbooks, but you might find the following helpful &mdash; particularly in revision during vacations. Each is aimed at upper-level undergraduates:

- Jonathan Dancy (1986) *An Introduction to Contemporary Epistemology* (Blackwell).
- Michael J. Loux and Thomas M. Crisp (2017) *Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction* (Routledge).   
- E\. J. Lowe (2002) *A Survey of Metaphysics* (OUP).  
- Jennifer Nagel (2015) *Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction* (OUP).

## 1. THE ANALYSIS of KNOWLEDGE  
[TOP](#top)

 
**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Do the Gettier problems show that knowledge cannot be analysed in terms of belief? Would we do better to explain belief in terms of knowledge?

**CORE READING**

**FURTHER READING**  
Weatherson (2003) is an interesting defence of the JTB analysis of knowledge. Greenough and Pritchard (2009) is a collection of papers on Williamson's epistemology. For helpful discussion of his arguments against analysis and his positive proposal that knowledge is the most general factive state, see the papers by Quassim Cassam and Elizabeth Fricker, as well as Williamson's replies. The Gettier problem has received a great deal of attention from so-called experimental philosophers. See Nagel (2012) for discussion and criticism of this. Hyman (2014) is a short piece arguing against Williamson's claim that knowledge is the most general factive stative attitude.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Is knowledge prior to belief? (2016)

Is knowledge the most general factive mental state? (2015)

‘It’s too easy to come up with counterexamples to putative analyses of knowledge in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so we should abandon the attempt to construct such analyses.’ Is this a compelling argument? And should we give up the project of analysing knowledge? (2014)‘The theory that knowledge is justified true belief is a simple and powerful proposal. Just as we accept simple and powerful, but highly counterintuitive, theories in fundamental physics, so too we may accept the knowledge proposal despite its counterintuitive consequences.’ Discuss.

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Is knowledge closed under known entailment? What significance does the issue have for the problem of external-world scepticism?

**CORE READING**  
\*Steven Luper (2001/2010) 'The Epistemic Closure Principle' in E. Zalta, ed. *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/closure-epistemic/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/closure-epistemic/).

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
How important is the concept of luck in epistemology? (2016)

Is it rational to believe each member of a finite set of propositions but fail to believe their conjunction? (2012)

Suppose that I would still believe P, were P false. Does it follow that I do not in fact know that P? (2010)

**EITHER** (a) Is knowledge just a true belief that is 'safe from error'? **OR** (b) Is knowledge just a true belief that in Nozick's sense 'tracks the truth'? (2009)

<a name="epistemic_contextualism"></a> 

## 3. EPISTEMIC CONTEXTUALISM 
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is epistemic contextualism? Is it correct? Does it offer a satisfactory response to the problem of external-world scepticism?

**CORE READING**  
\*Keith DeRose (1999) '[Contextualism: An Explanation and Defense](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2212/subscriber/uid=959/tocnode?id=g9780631202912_chunk_g978063120291211)' in J. Greco and E. Sosa, eds. *The Blackwell Guide to Epistemology* (Blackwell), pp. 187-205.

**FURTHER READING**  
DeRose (2009) is an up-to-date statement and defence of contextualism. Brown (2006) defends an orthodox invariantist position, opposed both to contextualism and the subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI) endorsed by the likes of Hawthorne and Stanley. The debate between contextualism and SSI raises questions about the role of pragmatic elements in knowledge. Fantl and McGrath (2009) is a great discussion of this. Conee and Cohen (2014) is a useful debate for and against contextualism. It includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to scepticism.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Is there any reason to think that ‘knows’ is context sensitive? What significance would it have for epistemology if this were so? (2016)

Can positing variation across contexts of standards for ascribing knowledge help solve sceptical puzzles? (2015)

Are there any reasons to think that ‘know’ is context-sensitive, other than its potentially affording a response to scepticism? (2014)

‘When S knows that p, that is a non-linguistic fact about S’s mental state. That fact will obtain regardless of the linguistic context, and, hence, S will know that p in every such context. So epistemic contextualism is false.’ Discuss. (2012)

## 4. A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE 
[TOP](#top)


**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is *a priori* knowledge? Do we have any? If so, how is it possible for us to have it? In particular, can the possibility of *a priori* knowledge be explained in terms of analyticity?

**CORE READING**  
\*Alex Orenstein (2002) [*W. V. Quine*](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/oxford/detail.action?docID=3060909) (Acumen), Ch. 4.  

W\. V. O. Quine (1951) '[Two Dogmas of Empiricism](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2181906)' in  *The Philosophical Review* 60(1), pp. 20–43. Reprinted in Quine (1961) *From a Logical Point of View*, revised ed. (Harvard).

**FURTHER READING**  
The rest of Bonjour (1998) is very useful, particularly the first three chapters. Kripke (1980) famously argues against identifying *a priori* knowability with necessity, arguing that there are both *a posteriori* necessities and *a priori* contingencies. The relevant selections are reprinted in Paul Moser, ed. (1987) *A Priori Knowledge* (OUP), as is Quine (1951) and a number of other classic papers on this topic. Boghossian (1997) is an interesting and influential attempt to resuscitate an account of the *a priori* in terms of analyticity. Williamson (2011) argues that the *a priori*/*a posteriori* distinction is of "little theoretical significance". Bonjour and Devitt (2014) debate whether anything is knowable *a priori*.

## 5. POSSIBLE WORLDS 
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is a possible world, and what reasons might there be for us to believe possible worlds other than the actual one exist?

**CORE READING**  
\*Joseph Melia (2003) *Modality* (Acumen), Ch. 1.  

David Lewis (1973) *Counterfactuals* (Blackwell), Ch. 4, §1.      
Robert Stalnaker (1976) '[Possible Worlds](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2214477)' in *Noûs* 10(1), pp. 65–75. Reprinted in **KK&S**.     
William Lycan (1998) 'Possible Worlds and Possibilia' in Cynthia Macdonald and Stephen Laurence, eds. *Contemporary Readings in the Foundation of Metaphysics* (Blackwell). Lewis's and Stalnaker's pieces are also reprinted in this volume.    
Ted Sider (2003) '[Reductive Theories of Modality](http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2067/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199284221.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199284221-e-8)' in M. J. Loux and D. W. Zimmerman, eds. *The Oxford Handbook of Metaphysics* (OUP), pp. 180-208.  

**FURTHER READING**  
If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the first three chapters of David Lewis's (1986) book are essential reading. The first lays out a case for his brand of modal realism, the second defends it from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. Bricker and Melia (2008) is a recent debate; they defend concretism and ersatzism respectively. The remaining suggestions all discuss other approaches. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach. Melia (1992) argues against modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explicated in terms of objects' essences.

‘If possible worlds are needed to explain modality, it is better not to explain modality.’ Do you agree? (2016)

‘No individual exists in more than one possible world, so possible worlds are of no use in accounting for possibility and necessity claims concerning particular individuals.’ Discuss. (2015)

‘Jane studies philosophy, but she could have studied history.’ Should such claims be understood in terms of possible worlds? (2014)

**EITHER** (a) ‘It is possible for there to be a blue swan; therefore there is a blue swan in some possible world; therefore there is a blue swan.’ Discuss. **OR** (b) ‘The world is not a possible world.’ Is this true according to the best account of modality? (2013)

## 6. CAUSATION  
[TOP](#top)


**ESSAY QUESTION**  
In what sense, if any, are causes necessary and/or sufficient for their effects? Can causation be understood in terms of counterfactuals?  

**CORE READING**

For an excellent, brief introduction to the topic, see Tim Crane (1995) 'Causation' in A. C. Grayling, ed. *Philosophy: A Guide Through the Subject* (OUP), esp. pp. 184-91. For more in-depth discussion, see Ernest Sosa and Michael Tooley (1993) 'Introduction' in Ernest Sosa and Michael Tooley, eds. *Causation* (OUP) (referred to below as **S&T**).

Dainton (2010) is excellent overview of the main issues. Zimmerman and Smart (2008) is a recent debate. Zimmerman defends presentism, a view most closely associated with Prior, while Smart, like Mellor, defends a B-theoretic view. Fine (2006) is difficult but rewards the effort, arguing for the reality of tense. Lewis (1976) is a defence of the possibility of backwards time travel.

**FURTHER READING**  
Zimmerman (1998) defends a presentist solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics. Hawthorne (2008) is a very useful discussion, distinguishing the question of whether objects *have* temporal parts with different properties from the question of whether objects change over time *because* they have temporal parts with different properties, opening up the prospect of a four-dimensionalist endurantism. Magidor (2016) argues most of the arguments offered for endurantism and perdurantism "crucially rely on theses which are strictly orthogonal to the [debate]". Thomson (1983) and Olson (2006) discuss another puzzle related to persistence over time: the issue of how objects can gain or lose parts over time.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘The following two claims are in tension: (1) There can be change over time; (2) At least some non-essential properties of objects are intrinsic.’ Explain how this tension might most plausibly be thought to arise. How would you propose to resolve it? (2016)

**EITHER** (a) ‘Consider a headless statue called “HEADLESS”. Suppose that at some later time T HEADLESS has been augmented by attaching a head to it. Call the whole statue after this augmentation “HEADY”. Consider the portion of HEADY consisting of the whole statue except for its head, and call that object “HEADY-MINUS”. On the one hand, we should say that HEADLESS has gained a head and is thus identical to HEADY. On the other hand, we should say that HEADLESS is identical to HEADY- MINUS. But these statements cannot both be true.’ How should this quandary be resolved? **OR** (b) Are there any good reasons to prefer the view that objects persist by perduring rather than by enduring? (2015)

What is the best account of how objects can gain or lose parts over time? (2014)

Is the phenomenon of change of properties over time any more puzzling than the variation of temperature along the length of an iron bar? (2013)

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘To say that valid predictions are those based on past regularities, without being able to say which regularities, is...pointless.’ (GOODMAN) How does this remark bear on the problem of what justifies us in making inferences from a finite number of instances to a general law subsuming these instances? (2016)

An item is grue if and only if either it is observed before a certain time T and is green, or it is not observed before T and is blue. Suppose that over 10,000 emeralds have been observed prior to time T and all were grue. Should one on that basis expect the first emerald observed after T to be grue? (2015)

What would it take to solve the problem of induction? (2014)Whether induction is rational is one question; whether induction is reliable is another. Need anything more be said to resolve the problem of induction? (2013)

How readily should one believe what others tell one? (2016)

What is involved in person A at time t1 being identical with person B at another time, t2? Is this a metaphysical question, a moral question, or something else? (2016)

Do psychological factors have the upper hand in accommodating our intuitions about when persons persist over time? Are psychological factors dominant in determining our intuitions regarding what it takes for a person to persist over time? (2015)

Does the psychological view of personal identity face challenges that other views on personal identity easily avoid? (2014)

‘Since there can be merely apparent memories, no account of personal identity can appeal to memories without begging the question.’ Does this follow? (2013)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Are there any individuals that do not exist?

**FURTHER READING**  
Quine's paper is the first salvo in a famous debate with Carnap. Carnap (1950) was the response, which in turn prompted Quine's famous 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism'. Quine was long regarded as having won the day, but the issue is now seen as less clear cut, owing at least in part to Yablo (1998), which discusses the debate and defends Carnap. Van Inwagen (1998) is a clear statement and defence of the Quinean position. Berto and Plebani's (2015) book is an accessible overview of work on this topic, defending the Quinean position - which they call the Standard View.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
What is the best methodology for resolving ontological disputes? (2015)

‘The standard of ontological commitment in metaphysics is the same as that in the sciences – one is committed to what one quantifies over in one’s best theory. Accordingly, it cannot be correct to castigate metaphysics as unscientific.’ Discuss. (2013)

Are ontological disputes merely verbal disputes over the choice of conventional linguistic framework? (2012)

‘Existence is a property like any other.’ Discuss. (2011)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Can the fact that Ruqia could have been a doctor be understood in terms of the properties that Ruqia herself has in other possible worlds? Can it be understood in terms of the properties that counterparts of Ruqia have in other possible worlds?

**FURTHER READING**  
Forbes (1985) argues that unless things have non-trivial individual essences, transworld identities will be problematically ungrounded. Mackie (2006) discusses Forbes. Lewis (1986) discusses his counterpart theory in more detail. Fara and Williamson (2005) argues against it. (Be warned: this paper is quite technical.) 

<!--
Fine (1994) discusses something related to issues of transworld identity, arguing that facts about an object's essential properties cannot be understood in terms of facts about its modal properties (such as its having that property in every possible world), but rather vice-versa: facts abouts its modal properties have to be understood in terms of its essential properties.-->

'No individual exists in more than one possible world, so possible worlds are of no use in accounting for possibility and necessity claims concerning particular individuals.' Discuss. (2015)

Could two distinct possible situations be qualitatively identical, differing only by permutation of their inhabitants? (2012)
